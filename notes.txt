Build a dashboard on emissions data in Python. Combine it with data on energy.

Use Streamlit for deployment and in combination with Dash for interactive graphics.

Learn more about emissions and energy data, find interesting questions.

Learn to use Dash, learn how to build dashboards and what are good design principles.

Need a primary question:
	a) How far are we on the way to have mostly sustainable/non-emitant energy generation?
	b) ...
	
Use a Notebook for the thought process and EDA

next steps:
	1. find data
	2. find a question
		2.1 find metrics/subquestions
	3. do EDA
	4. prepare graphs
	5. put them together in a dashboard
	6. deploy
	
1. done: GHGHighlights
2. done: How much green house gases are emitted by sector and country? And over time?
			Are there some interesting correlations?
